# decay-weighted-vegetation-indices-LANDSAT
This repository contains a Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript script that processes vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) from MapBiomas Landsat mosaics by applying temporal decay weights to create smoothed annual composites. The approach incorporates historical context by weighting previous years' data using an exponential decay function.
